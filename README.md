SortViz is a sorting algorithm visualizer that brings to life some of the most widely used sorting algorithms, including quicksort, mergesort, bubblesort, selection sort, and insertion sort. It's an interactive tool designed to enhance understanding and provide insights into how these algorithms work.

Built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, SortViz is a visually appealing and user-friendly application. Its purpose is to showcase the step-by-step execution of sorting algorithms on a given set of numbers. By observing the sorting process in action, users can gain a deeper understanding of how each algorithm operates and the impact it has on the efficiency of sorting.
